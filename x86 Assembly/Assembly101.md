## What is binary exploitation?

Binary exploitation is the process of taking compiled executables and making them do what you want them to do.

## Compilers

When you write a C program and start with the process of compiling it, your C file is read by the compiler, which will convert the code that you have written into a sequence of operations that will be executed by a computer. This sequence of operations are written in assembly.

For example:

```
#include <stdio.h>

void main(void)
{
	puts("Hello World!");
}
```

This C code isn't what is gonna run on your computer, for its instructions to be executed it first need to be compiled into assembly code:

```
gcc hello.c -o hello
```

Using `objdump`we can see what is the assembly code of this program looks like:

```
0000000000001149 <main>:
    1149:	f3 0f 1e fa          	endbr64 
    114d:	55                   	push   rbp
    114e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp
    1151:	48 8d 3d ac 0e 00 00 	lea    rdi,[rip+0xeac]        # 2004 <_IO_stdin_used+0x4>
    1158:	e8 f3 fe ff ff       	call   1050 <puts@plt>
    115d:	90                   	nop
    115e:	5d                   	pop    rbp
    115f:	c3                   	ret    
```

In order to understand what is actually happening when you run an executable, you must understand assembly. But to understand assembly, you first need to understand the basic elements of an executable.

There are two main architectures that dictate how our programs are compiled and executed: 32-bit(x86) and 64-bit(x64).

Every C program has four main components:
<ol>
  <li>Heap</li>
  <li>Stack</li>
  <li>Registers</li>
  <li>Instructions</li>
</ol>

## Heap

The heap is an area in memory designed for the purpose of manual memory allocation. Memory is allocated on the heap wheneaver functions such as `malloc` and `calloc` are called, as well as when global or static variables are declared.

(The inner workings of the heal are extremely complicated so that is all I am going to mention on this overview)
